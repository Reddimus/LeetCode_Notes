# LeetCode #1143 - Longest Common Subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/description/

### Difficulty: `Medium`

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest **common subsequence**. If there is no **common subsequence**, return 0.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

* For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

### Example 1:
Input: 
```
text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
```
Output: 
```
3
```
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

### Example 2:
Input: 
```
text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
```
Output: 
```
3
```
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

### Example 3:
Input: 
```
text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
```
Output: 
```
0
```
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

## Constraints

* `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
* `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.
