# LeetCode #121 - Best Time to Buy And Sell Stock

https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return the *maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

### Example 1:
#### Input
```
prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
```
#### Output
```
5
```
#### Explanation
Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 - 1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

### Example 2:
#### Input
```
prices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
```
#### Output
```
0
```
#### Explanation
In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

### Constraints
- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`
