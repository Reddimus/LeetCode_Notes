LeetCode # 374 - Guess Number Higher or Lower prompt:

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I 
picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three 
possible results:

-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).

Return the number that I picked. 

Example 1:
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6

Example 2:
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
1 <= pick <= n

# Ex 1:
assert Solution(pick = 6).guessNumber(n = 10) == 6

# Ex 2:
assert Solution(pick = 1).guessNumber(n = 1) == 1

# Ex 3:
assert Solution(pick = 1).guessNumber(n = 2) == 1
